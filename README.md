# http-echo-server

Will accept any TCP connection and echo back a HTTP response with the
entire content of the incoming TCP connection.

The server makes no attempt to understand the incoming HTTP request
hence it doesn't know when the request is completed and therefore just
terminates the TCP connection 2 seconds after the first data packet.
